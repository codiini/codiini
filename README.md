## Hola üëãüèæ

I am Iniubong Obonguko, a Software Engineer and Technical writer. I love to create beautiful web interfaces and share knowledge acquired from the process. 
As a freelance technical writer for various publications and companies, I create content on my [blog](https://blog.iniubong.com).

## What I'm currently interested in
I'm interested in working on open-source developer tooling and optimizing the developer experience via the tools/libraries they use daily.

## Hola 👋🏾

I am Iniubong Obonguko, a Software Engineer and Technical writer. I love to create beautiful web interfaces and share knowledge acquired from the process. 
As a freelance technical writer for various publications and companies, I create content on my [blog](https://blog.iniubong.com).

## What I'm currently interested in

I'm interested in blockchain technology and how to integrate it into the currently available technology. I believe it is the future of the internet, and I try to create content around what I have learned on my blog and other companies.

## Hola 👋🏾

I create content on my [blog](https://blog.iniubongobonguko.com) and work as a freelance technical writer for various publocations and companies.

## What I'm currently interested in

I'm currently interested in blockchain technology and web.3.0 and how to integrate it into the current technology available. I believe it is the future of the internet and I try to create some content around my learnings on web3.0 for my blog and other companies.
